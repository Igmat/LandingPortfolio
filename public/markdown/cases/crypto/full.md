## Challenge Statement:

Design an intuitive and user-centric interface that seamlessly integrates streaming content and auction functionality, allowing content creators and their audience to interact, bid, and engage with ease while ensuring transparency and security in the use of custom crypto tokens.

## Key Objectives:
1. User Onboarding and Education: Develop a user onboarding process that helps users understand the concept of custom crypto tokens, how bidding works, and the value of exclusive content. Ensure that users feel confident in participating in auctions and engaging with creators.
2. Streamlined Bidding: Create an efficient and enjoyable bidding experience. Users should be able to place bids, monitor their auctions, and set bid limits with ease. Minimize friction and make the process as transparent as possible.
3. Creator-User Interaction: Facilitate meaningful interactions between content creators and their audience. Design features that enable creators to engage with their audience, such as live Q&A sessions during auctions or direct messaging.
4. Transparency and Security: Prioritize the security of custom crypto tokens. Implement robust security measures to protect users' assets and maintain a transparent ledger of transactions, ensuring the platform's credibility for creators who rely on it for sustainable income.
