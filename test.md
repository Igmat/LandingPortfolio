## Challenge Statement:

Design an intuitive and user-centric interface that seamlessly
integrates streaming content and auction functionality, allowing content
creators and their audience to interact, bid, and engage with ease while
ensuring transparency and security in the use of custom crypto tokens.

## Key Objectives:

1.  User Onboarding and Education: Develop a user onboarding process
    that helps users understand the concept of custom crypto tokens, how
    bidding works, and the value of exclusive content. Ensure that users
    feel confident in participating in auctions and engaging with
    creators.
2.  Streamlined Bidding: Create an efficient and enjoyable bidding
    experience. Users should be able to place bids, monitor their
    auctions, and set bid limits with ease. Minimize friction and make
    the process as transparent as possible.
3.  Creator-User Interaction: Facilitate meaningful interactions between
    content creators and their audience. Design features that enable
    creators to engage with their audience, such as live Q&A sessions
    during auctions or direct messaging.
4.  Transparency and Security: Prioritize the security of custom crypto
    tokens. Implement robust security measures to protect users\' assets
    and maintain a transparent ledger of transactions, ensuring the
    platform\'s credibility for creators who rely on it for sustainable
    income.
